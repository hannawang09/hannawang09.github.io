Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://aimerykong.github.io/group.html) at the [FST department](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/) of [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) (UM), supervised by [Prof. Shu Kong](https://aimerykong.github.io). I received my M.S. degree of Information and Communication Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC) in 2024. 


My current research focuses on **computer vision**, especially to *enhance the robustness of foundation models for downstream task adaptation with limited data*. During my master's study, I also explored *the application of continual learning on activity recognition*.
