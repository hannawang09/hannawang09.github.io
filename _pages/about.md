Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://aimerykong.github.io/group.html) at the [FST department](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/) of [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) (UM), supervised by [Prof. Shu Kong](https://aimerykong.github.io). I received my M.S. degree of Information and Communication Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2024. My current research focuses on **computer vision**, especially *enhancing the robustness of foundation models when adapting to downstream tasks with limited data*.
